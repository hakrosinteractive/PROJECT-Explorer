# PROJECT-Explorer
Support program to perform searches in projects made with .NET

What can be done with the program?

- Search in all projects at once.
- Search by name, path and content
- For content search it is possible:
    
    - Search full phrases or stand-alone terms
    - Search all the terms in the same or different files.
    - Search in the same line for several terms that are not necessarily consecutive

- Search filters by extension and/or keywords
- Quick filters to automatically filter certain types of files (include/exclude).
- The results show the project and solution to which the selected file belongs, being able to load the solution directly.
- Each search carried out is saved in a separate tab so that it is possible to switch between them (but they are not saved when you exit the program).
- Export to text/Excel the results obtained.
- Highlight result rows manually to mark files.
- Different styles (Light and Dark).

Finally, the program incorporates a complete menu to quickly access all the most useful Windows options as well as a submenu of 'special tools' created to help in development.

Test Manager

- This module allows you to create test records following the different steps of a task described in the TFS, the sections are highlighted when you click on them
- And the changes are saved automatically. It is especially useful to control the steps passed and those not.
- The steps and expected results of the TFS are entered in text format and the table is generated automatically.

Local Backup

- This module allows you to make local backups of modified files
- The module must be activated with the checkbox in the lower left corner for it to work (it is not activated by default).
- Obviously it is not as complete as TFS but it allows automatic backups of any file modified in the solution
- And then it allows you to compare the changes between the different versions and between the latest version using the visual studio file comparator.

SQL Extractor

- This module allows you to extract the SQL code from several files and join them in just one.
- Automatically detects the project's scripts folder.
- Very useful for when many scripts have to be executed in the database.

Safeboard

- This module is a password generator based on a project I did a long time ago.
- In essence, I already had it done and I have incorporated it for you because it is always good to have a password generator.
- Allows you to generate a secure password using a combination keyboard.
- The order of the combination affects the result generating different passwords.
- The same combination always generates the same password but the order must be the same.
